# Webpack Boilerplate for Cloudflare Workers

Use `require()` to your ‚ù§'s desire, and deploy your freshly-bundled Cloudflare Worker to the edge

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository:
    ````bash
      git clone git@github.com:detroitenglish/cloudflare-worker-webpack-boilerplate.git
      cd cloudflare-worker-webpack-boilerplate
    ````
2. Rename `example.env` to `.env`, and edit the configuration variables as required.
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`
4. Write your worker script in `src/worker.js`
   - Add any dependencies for your worker with: `npm install -P <some-required-package>`
   - Build a preview of your bundled worker script (in `dist/bundled-worker.js`) by running: `npm run build`
5. Bundle your worker and launch üöÄ with: `npm run deploy`

## Configuration

### Credentials and Zone ID

The following are **required** in your `.env` file:

- `CLOUDFLARE_AUTH_EMAIL`: Your Cloudflare account email address

- `CLOUDFLARE_AUTH_KEY`: Your Cloudflare API-Key

- `CLOUDFLARE_ZONE_ID`: The Zone ID to which your worker will be deployed.

## Default Webpack Configuration

### Minification
Webpack is configured to minify your script before deployment to help keep your script under the 1MB limit. Building a preview with `npm run build` will not minify the bundles script to make debugging easier.

### Cloudflare Worker Webpack Plugin
Script uploading and route pattern management are handled by the same author's `cloudflare-worker-webpack-plugin`.

You can review how it works and find additional configuration options in the [plugin's documentation](https://github.com/detroitenglish/cloudflare-worker-webpack-plugin).

### Babel

Babel is included so that you can write JavaScript using the same syntaxes and features found in the latest version of Chrome **without** running to incompatibilities with your version of NodeJS.

This particular Babel configuration will only add polyfills to your bundle if it determines they are necessary for Chrome compatibility.

### Custom Variables

See `example.env` for details and examples on adding and injecting custom variables.

### Route Patterns

See `example.env` for details and examples on how route patterns are deployed.
